                    Today my main goals are to finish drill A from "build multi-page website" and get a good start on B. I have already made
                        very good progress in A and I believe I can finish that before lunch. After Lunch and before 4:15 I would like to have
                        a significant amount of B done, if not all of it. Lastly, I would like to fix the two kickbacks I have from the Command
                        line. To do this, I am going to split these tasks up into SMART goals.
                        <br>
                        <br> To finish task A I plan to:
                        <br> Finish building the HTML for the bottom of the Main section. Then use Flex-box to align all elements correctly. Build
                        the footer and add all information that is needed. I plan on finishing this task before lunch. This task should not take
                        me anymore then then 3 hours.
                        <br>
                        <br> To finish task B I plan to:
                        <br> I will read the material that is needed to complete this task. I plan on having a whiteboard session with myself and
                        have an outline for the project with planned HTML and CSS. This should not take me more than 60 minuets (1pm). Once I
                        have my whiteboard plan I will start building my HTML. Building my HTML should not take any longer than two hours (3pm).
                        Once that Is completed I will start the task of CSS. My CSS should not take any longer (if planned correctly) then 60
                        minuets (4pm). Fix kickbacks: If I stay on track I should have 30 minuets to fix my kickbacks. To fix my two kickbacks
                        I will re-attempt the tasks and turn them in by 4:30. At this time, I should be ready for stand-down.
