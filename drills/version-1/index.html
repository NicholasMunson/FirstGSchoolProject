                    <p>I am a Colorado native and I love it here! I have a lovely little family that
                        consists of my wife Hannah, and our dogs Ruca, and Anabelle. My hobbies include
                        skateboarding, snowboarding, beers, music, traveling, hanging with friends,
                        family and having a good time! I am currently a student at Galvanize Platt
                        enrolled in the full-stack development program. I decided that I was bored with
                        what I was doing and needed a change. I decided to take a chance, and get out of
                        the hospitality industry and try my luck at tech. I love to learn and overcome
                        challenges so, that is why I enrolled at Galvanize! I am excited about this new
                        chapter in my life. I have felt like I have had no direction for sure a long
                        time, but through this program I have lost that feeling. In a nutshell that is
                        my life.

                        <li>
                            <p>Today my main goals are to finish drill A from "build multi-page website" and
                                get a good start on B. I have already made very good progress in A and I believe
                                I can finish that before lunch. After Lunch and before 4:15 I would like to have
                                a significant amount of B done, if not all of it. Lastly, I would like to fix
                                the two kickbacks I have from the Command line. To do this, I am going to split
                                these tasks up into SMART goals.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To finish task A I plan to:
                                <br>
                                Finish building the HTML for the bottom of the Main section. Then use Flex-box
                                to align all elements correctly. Build the footer and add all information that
                                is needed. I plan on finishing this task before lunch. This task should not take
                                me anymore then then 3 hours.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To finish task B I plan to:
                                <br>
                                I will read the material that is needed to complete this task. I plan on having
                                a whiteboard session with myself and have an outline for the project with
                                planned HTML and CSS. This should not take me more than 60 minuets (1pm). Once I
                                have my whiteboard plan I will start building my HTML. Building my HTML should
                                not take any longer than two hours (3pm). Once that Is completed I will start
                                the task of CSS. My CSS should not take any longer (if planned correctly) then
                                60 minuets (4pm). Fix kickbacks: If I stay on track I should have 30 minuets to
                                fix my kickbacks. To fix my two kickbacks I will re-attempt the tasks and turn
                                them in by 4:30. At this time, I should be ready for stand-down.</p>

                            <p>Today went okay. I hit many of my goals but not all of them. fell short on
                                that goal and plan to make it top priority tomorrow. I did however, finish my
                                kickbacks. I hit most of my goals, but I could have done better. I completed
                                task A but, it took more time then I had anticipated. I had some trouble with my
                                HTML and CSS not allowing flexbox to do its job. I was feeling a bit defeated,
                                but I used the developer tools in Chrome to figure out my mistakes. I was not
                                making the correct elements parents to control the children, so flexbox was not
                                responding correctly. I fixed my mistakes and rewrote my HTML so that I would
                                not have this problem. I completed this task around 2:30. The time I was
                                planning on starting B had already passed so I decided to draw up a whiteboard
                                plan for B and finish my kickbacks by stand-down (4:30pm). I took too much time
                                on my goals for A so that is why this goal was not met. My kickbacks went well
                                because I knew what I did wrong and how to fix them. After using command line
                                for a few weeks,I am much faster with it and I have a much better understanding
                                then when I originally did the task. I am feeling confident that they will pass
                                now.

                            <p>What could I have done to make A go smoother?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I believe that I would not have had this problem if I would have planned out my
                                HTML structure more in the whiteboard stage. In the future I will take more time
                                in the whiteboard stage to ensure that my plans will work. This will lower the
                                amount of time I will need to trouble shoot.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How could have I made my workflow better?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I think if I started with my kickbacks I would have had more momentum going into
                                my goals and would have felt less defeated and been in a better mindset.</p>

                            <p>Today my goals are to finish preparing my lighting talk PowerPoint before
                                lunch. Then I plan to start my personal website and finish the HTML before I
                                present my lightning talk at 3:50pm. After my talk, I plan on finishing my smart
                                goals B project.

                                To finish task A I plan to:
                                <br>
                                I need to add three slides to each of my sections for my presentation. I have
                                four sections to finish, so twelve slides. I have already selected the pictures
                                I am going to use so that will not take up much time.
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                I plan on whiteboarding my site out after lunch from 1-2pm. Once I have my
                                whiteboard plan I will start building my HTML. I will only have about an hour to
                                make this happen, but I do not plan on rushing anything because that is how
                                mistakes are made. Once that Is completed I will start the task of CSS, but I do
                                not plan on getting to that step today.

                                After my lightning talk I plan on writing my reflection before going to a meet
                                up. I should be able to write that up in twenty minutes or so.

                            <p>Today went okay. I did not get as far along as I wanted to on the HTML
                                because I forgot that we had career services presentation today at one. So,
                                because I forgot to check my calendar and slack I fell short on my goals for the
                                day. I did finish my lightning talk PowerPoint before lunch because I had
                                planned it out well previously. My whiteboarding for my bucket project went
                                well. I like planning and double checking before I start to build. The only
                                thing that did not go well was my time management today. I should have looked at
                                my calendar I could have better planned my day. Tomorrow I will double check my
                                calendar and plan my day out better so that I can be more productive.</p>

                            <p>Today, I plan on writing all the HTML for my project in bucket one before
                                lunch. If I can finish before lunch and start the CSS that will be a bonus. My
                                next goal is to write up the meetup from last night. Once that I finished I plan
                                on getting back into the CSS for my project. I believe that I can finish that
                                before the end of the day (3:50pm).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To finish task A I plan to:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To finish my HTML by lunch I plan on fallowing my whiteboard plan to make it
                                happen. If my whiteboard plan is a good one (which I believe it is), it should
                                not take long to build the HTML in the two hours that I have to finish it before
                                lunch. I am hopeful that I will finish with some time before lunch then I will
                                get a head start on the CSS.
                                <br>

                                To finish task B I plan to:

                                <br>
                                After lunch I plan on writing up my meetup reflection from the night before.
                                This should not take very long, an hour at the most.
                                <br>
                                <br>To finish task C I plan to:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The CSS usually takes me longer then the HTML because it is still a little bit
                                of trial and error. However, I do believe that I can finish the CSS before the
                                end of the day (3:50pm). If I stick to my plan and not play with the developer
                                tools to much.

                                Today, my goals were not met. I did complete my HTML for my project and write up
                                the meet up information, so those were two wins. Unfortunately, I did not finish
                                the CSS. I could not decide how I wanted to structure my website. I had an idea
                                when writing my HTML, but I decided that it was not going to look good. So, I
                                searched online for some inspiration. That inspiration conquest took way to
                                long. I should have stuck to the plan or only gave myself a few minutes to find
                                some inspiration. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure something out that
                                should have already been planned out. Tomorrow I will make sure to use my time
                                more effectively and if I need to google something for inspiration I will make
                                sure to limit it to just a few minutes.

                                <br>
                                For me, this is done by first by putting myself in an environment that is best
                                for learning. I am a very social person so I need to be away from social
                                situations. I find a nice quiet place with very little distractions. I thin turn
                                off all my notifications on my cell and mac. I then put on good music that
                                allows me to stay focused on the task. lastly, I set my Pomodoro clock so that I
                                stay focused for those 25 mins without allowing myself to go off task.

                                What:“Today I am going to learn basic commands in the command line/ oh my zsh,
                                and how it works.” Why: “ I am learning this because command line is a faster
                                and more powerful tool then using the gooies. Command Line when used with oh my
                                zsh can be unstoppable”.

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Think about different ways something can be done. Try something that can be
                                faster and more efficient. So in Command Line, try to use the command “touch” to
                                create multiple files at the same time “ touch index.html main.css”. If
                                something more complex is required wrestle with it. Try many different ways to
                                make something work. The worst thing that happens is that it does not work.
                                <br>

                                2: Take Risks!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In command line it is kind of hard to take risks, but getting out of the comfort
                                zone is what this is all about. Trying something new is a way to grow. Can I
                                make a directory and a file at the same time with the file staying in that
                                directory? If so how would I do that? maybe this “mkdir test touch
                                ./test/newfolder”… No it just made directories “test”, “touch”, and “newfloder”,
                                but “newfolder” was put into the “test” directory. I cannot make touch files and
                                mkdir directories at the same time but I can make new directories at the same
                                time and nest them at the same time. I learned something I did not set out to
                                learn so, that is awesome! I found that can remove all of these directories at
                                the same time without a force! Pretty cool stuff!
                                <br>

                                3: Have Fun!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Working with new technologies is always exciting. The best way to really figure
                                them out is by playing with them. New technologies are sometimes scary because
                                they are new. It is best to keep a level head that is focused on growth and not
                                a fixed mindset that does not allow growth. When a situation pops up that is
                                challenging do not say “I can’t do this” or “this is to hard” instead think
                                about it in a different approach. Think about these challenges as opportunities
                                to grow. Try many things that may or may not work. Having fun is something that
                                can benefit you later. In command line I tried to making two directories at the
                                same time like I can with the “touch” command. It worked! Now I do not need
                                those directories so lets remove them. can I remove more then one at a time?
                                Yes!

                                I am feeling good about what I accomplished. I think I challenged myself but I
                                could do better. The stage I set was a good one. I minimized distractions and
                                was able to focus on my tasks and play more. I think I can be faster at command
                                line by knowing the short cuts. Next, I want to do more research on Zsh so that
                                I understand the full power that it holds.

                                I need to find a better lit area that is more comfortable. Harsh lighting on the
                                second floor in those study cubes is distracting. Without the light it is to
                                dark. I wish there was a way to soften up the lights here.

                                What: Today I am learning how to use the DOM. DOM stands for document object
                                model or DOM it is a programing interface that helps developers manipulate
                                content.
                                <br>
                                Why: DOM is important because it allows developers to manipulate content using
                                languages like JavaScript and Python. Using the DOM we can change the document
                                structure, style, and content.

                                1: wrestle with the tasks.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the DOM I can wrestle with lots of different things. Targeting a specific
                                element can be done in many ways. querySelector, querySelctorAll, getElementByID
                                or Class. I personally, like querySelector and querySelectorAll. I like them
                                because I can use CSS style referencing like this
                                document.querySelectorAll(".class ") .
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                2: Take Risks!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Taking risks in DOM is easy. I tried to do many things with this new technology,
                                like target an element with no text content and then add some. I see that loops
                                are a big part of DOM. Whenever I will need to iterate through a part of the DOM
                                and attach something to many things or do the same thing to many elements. I
                                feel like this is a powerful tool and I will need to take some time to get to
                                know it better.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                3: Have Fun!
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I can see how this technology can be fun. Grabbing things and modifying them is
                                something that could be lots of fun. So, I decided to see if I could add some
                                text to an empty using DOM manipulation. I targeted the element that I wanted to
                                modify and then I added some words to it using the DOM! I then added a class to
                                the same tag. Seeing the power of DOM is fun and using it is even more fun.

                            <p>
                                I am feeling okay with the DOM. I think I need to work on my JS skills to fully
                                be able to use the DOM as it was intended. I think that is my only roadblock
                                when using the DOM I am not all that good at looping things yet. So, a JS
                                refresh will be awesome. I am feeling like I can do very small things on the DOM
                                right now. I want to challenge myself more, but with my small amount of
                                knowledge of JS I feel like I am holding myself back. My goal is to get better
                                with JS so that I can use the DOM in better ways. I think the way I set the
                                stage helped for sure, but I need to be isolated when reading because I hate
                                reading and I will use any excuse not to do it. In this program reading is a
                                huge part of it so I need to figure that out now.

                                Today I am going to be learning more about CSS and flexbox. I am building my
                                website today and intend on learning a lot about CSS. I know a good amount of
                                CSS already, but I can always learn more and be better at CSS styling. I believe
                                that I will learn lots of new things that are useful when building a website. I
                                have set my stage by getting into a space where I can focus and not be around
                                other people. I tend to be social when others are around.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I cleared the stage by turning on my do not disturb function on all my devices.
                                I do this so that I do not get distracted. I also sat next to some people on the
                                fourth floor that I did not know so that I would not be tempted to talk to
                                others. I like sitting upstairs because of the sunlight. I believe that I have
                                found a good spot to accomplish my goals for the day.

                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="listTitle">Play</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                I used a lot of play today. I wanted to make a website that used parallax
                                scrolling. I was able to make that happen, but the images I used were stretching
                                and I could not figure out how to stop them from doing that. I then noticed that
                                I may have to rewrite my HTML to make the desired functionality happen the way I
                                want it to. Since I am under a time crunch I decided to keep it simple and just
                                use one picture. I also played with the sizing of many things. I found that I
                                like the "em" sizing best. I like it more than "px" because it covers more space
                                and there is less guessing involved. I used flex-box a lot in this project. I
                                like how responsive it is. However, I did find issues with it when creating a
                                navigation bar. Thankfully I saved the CSS flex-box cheat sheet Brooks showed
                                us. It was extremely helpful.

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Today was productive. I think I set the stage well and took breaks at good times
                                so that I did not get burnt out too fast. I liked working upstairs with the
                                sunlight peaking in every so often. Having some sunlight makes me happy and feel
                                good. I think doing this has kept me super productive today. I stayed in a good
                                mindset today. When I came across something hard I asked my friends for help and
                                used google often. CSS has a lot going on with it and I feel like I have just
                                scraped the surface of this technology. I want to continue exploring the
                                functionality of CSS and try new things. I feel like there are easier ways to do
                                some of the things that I want to do. I just need some more time playing with
                                it.

                            I learned that CSS is more powerful then I had originally thought. It can be
                            used to do basic Javascript like functions. In one example of a list where the
                            text would be red if there were less than three things, or seven or more things
                            on this list. It was to show that having more than three goals is good but no
                            more than six. They also explained the hierarchy of CSS selectors and how CSS
                            specificity can help overrule pervious rules set in the CSS. I did not learn a
                            lot of new things, but it was fun seeing the power of CSS.

                            I learned that even though we are going to be fresh out of school we can be
                            hired because we will work for less money than someone else who has been in the
                            field for a while. This is true especially at small startups. Quinten also
                            mentioned that his company only works Monday –Thursday as a full-time employee.
                            They have a 32-hour work week that helps them be more productive.

                            With the philosophy of a 32-hour work week, is the same amount of output
                            happening when compared to a traditional 40 hours.

                            I learned that it is okay to roll with the no's in the world of business. Even
                            when an idea is off the wall. We can make it happen if we try hard enough. Many
                            of the business owners struggled to make their dream happen but did it against
                            the odds. Many business' fail in the first-year because of over saturation in
                            the market, or lack of capitol. I learned that sticking to what you are good at
                            in business and not trying new things can help build a business. Being good at
                            what you like to do can go a long way.
