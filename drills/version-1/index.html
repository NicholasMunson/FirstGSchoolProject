                    <li class="listTitle">March 3rd 2018 Goals</li>
                    <li><p>Today my main goals are to finish drill A from "build multi-page website" and get a good start on B. I have already made very good progress in A and I believe I can finish that before lunch. After Lunch and before 4:15 I would like to have a significant amount of B done, if not all of it. Lastly, I would like to fix the two kickbacks I have from the Command line. To do this, I am going to split these tasks up into SMART goals. <br>
                            <br>
                            To finish task A I plan to:
                            <br>
                            Finish building the HTML for the bottom of the Main section. Then use Flex-box to align all elements correctly. Build the footer and add all information that is needed. I plan on finishing this task before lunch. This task should not take me anymore then then 3 hours.
                            <br> <br>
                            To finish task B I plan to:
                            <br> 
                            I will read the material that is needed to complete this task. I plan on having a whiteboard session with myself and have an outline for the project with planned HTML and CSS. This should not take me more than 60 minuets (1pm).
                            
                            Once I have my whiteboard plan I will start building my HTML. Building my HTML should not take any longer than two hours (3pm). Once that Is completed I will start the task of CSS.
                            
                            My CSS should not take any longer (if planned correctly) then 60 minuets (4pm). Fix kickbacks:
                            
                            If I stay on track I should have 30 minuets to fix my kickbacks. To fix my two kickbacks I will re-attempt the tasks and turn them in by 4:30. At this time, I should be ready for stand-down.</p></li> 
                    <li class="listTitle">Reflection</li>
                    <li><p>Today went okay. I hit many of my goals but not all of them. fell short on that goal and plan to make it top priority tomorrow. I did however, finish my kickbacks. I hit most of my goals, but I could have done better.

                            I completed task A but, it took more time then I had anticipated. I had some trouble with my HTML and CSS not allowing flexbox to do its job. I was feeling a bit defeated, but I used the developer tools in Chrome to figure out my mistakes. I was not making the correct elements parents to control the children, so flexbox was not responding correctly. I fixed my mistakes and rewrote my HTML so that I would not have this problem. I completed this task around 2:30.
                            
                            The time I was planning on starting B had already passed so I decided to draw up a whiteboard plan for B and finish my kickbacks by stand-down (4:30pm). I took too much time on my goals for A so that is why this goal was not met.
                            
                            My kickbacks went well because I knew what I did wrong and how to fix them. After using command line for a few weeks,I am much faster with it and I have a much better understanding then when I originally did the task. I am feeling confident that they will pass now.

                    <li><p>What could I have done to make A go smoother? <br> <br>

                            I believe that I would not have had this problem if I would have planned out my HTML structure more in the whiteboard stage. In the future I will take more time in the whiteboard stage to ensure that my plans will work. This will lower the amount of time I will need to trouble shoot.
                            <br> <br>
                            How could have I made my workflow better?
                            <br> <br>
                            I think if I started with my kickbacks I would have had more momentum going into my goals and would have felt less defeated and been in a better mindset.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Today my goals are to finish preparing my lighting talk PowerPoint before lunch. Then I plan to start my personal website and finish the HTML before I present my lightning talk at 3:50pm. After my talk, I plan on finishing my smart goals B project. <br> <br> To finish task A I plan to: <br>
                        I need to add three slides to each of my sections for my presentation. I have four sections to finish, so twelve slides. I have already selected the pictures I am going to use so that will not take up much time. <br> <br> To finish task B I plan to: <br> I plan on whiteboarding my site out after lunch from 1-2pm. Once I have my whiteboard plan I will start building my HTML. I will only have about an hour to make this happen, but I do not plan on rushing anything because that is how mistakes are made. Once that Is completed I will start the task of CSS, but I do not plan on getting to that step today. <br> <br> To finish task C I plan to: <br> After my lightning talk I plan on writing my reflection before going to a meet up. I should be able to write that up in twenty minutes or so. <br>
                    </p></li> 
                    <li class="listTitle">Reflection</li>
                    <li><p>Today went okay. I did not get as far along as I wanted to on the HTML because I forgot that we had career services presentation today at one. So, because I forgot to check my calendar and slack I fell short on my goals for the day. I did finish my lightning talk PowerPoint before lunch because I had planned it out well previously. My whiteboarding for my bucket project went well. I like planning and double checking before I start to build. The only thing that did not go well was my time management today. I should have looked at my calendar I could have better planned my day. Tomorrow I will double check my calendar and plan my day out better so that I can be more productive.</p></li>
                    <li class="listTitle">Questions</li>
                    <li><p>How could I have made the day more productive besides checking my calendar? <br> <br>

                            Should I start my day with smaller goals since I have less time before lunch?
                            <br> <br>
                            Do my goals match up with my weekly goals? (I set weekly goals on Mondays)</p></li>
